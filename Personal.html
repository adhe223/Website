		<h2>Faolin: Text Based RPG</h2>
    	<p>Faolin is a text based RPG that I put together in C++ as a learning exercise. I was hoping to gain a greater understanding of game principles and structure. The game features an algorithm to randomly generate the world (mountains, rivers, plains), a working map available to the player, a leveling system, the ability to save and load games, as well as other general RPG elements. </p>

    	<h2>This Website!</h2>
        <p>This website itself was my first HTML + CSS project. I decided to create it using only HTML or CSS code. I have not used any website creation tools, plugins, or pre-written code in its development. Unfortunately I am not an expert on website creation. You may experience some visual errors on very small resolution screens (smaller monitors, phones) and for that I apologize!</p>
